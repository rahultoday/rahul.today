<h1>Config :</h1> 

In the project directory, you can run:
<br/>
<br/>
<b> For Development <b> 
### `npm install`
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b> For Deployment<b> 
### `npm run build`

<b> Technology stack</b>

1. Bootstrap 4 : To implement the grid system.
2. Redux-React : Since the page is view oriented, React is choosen and there is a need of grip on data which can be achieved by redux.
3. react-scripts : Build process is handled by react-scrips, a webpack based build tool.
4. scss and css : React components are styled by scss and out-side portions are handled in pure css.
5. WebStorm Boilerplate for HTML-5 : Basic HTML and CSS structure.
 
<b>Assumptions made :</b>

1. Since API's are not enough to populate all field's somefields are filled with available data.
2. Some of the repeated portions are iterated inside components, But few are hard coded since we can achieve the same by iterator.
3. CORS issue are handled using Proxying server, Since CORS releated header are missing in API,
   used proxy server to handle it.(In this task, i have used https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/)
